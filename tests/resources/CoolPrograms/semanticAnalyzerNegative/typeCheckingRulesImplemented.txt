Type Checking rules implemented

CLASS:
	1. Didn't define a Main class
	2. Inherited from Int/Bool/String (report line number of Int/Bool/String)

METHOD:
	1. Didn't define a main method inside Main that had 0 parameters

EXPRESSIONS:
    4. [Var] (doesn't need tests)
    3. [ASSIGN]
    [True], [False] have no hypotheses so they are trivially checked
    [Int], [String] have hypotheses that are enforced by C++ types so they are trivially checked
    5. [New] (doesn't need tests)
       [Dispatch]
       [Static Dispatch]
	1. [If]
    [Sequence] is trivially checked
    9. [Let-Init]
    [Let-No-Init]
    [Case]
	2. [Loop]
	[Isvoid]
	6. [Not] and [Neg] (writing tests)
	7. [Arith]
	8. [Equal] and [LT] and [LTE]
	[Attr-Init]
	[Method]

ivan rules implemented
EXPRESSIONS:
    Let:
